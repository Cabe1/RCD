                    <h3>Results of our Needs Assessment</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to evaluate the need for a quality child care in Radford, we conducted a needs assessment with members of the Radford community this year. We sought to measure the discrepancy between the current condition and the desired condition. We determined and documented a critical need in quality child care in Radford.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of 1300 parents surveyed in Radford, 337 parents could not find quality child care, more than 220 parents were likely or very likely to switch to Radford Child Development Center.
